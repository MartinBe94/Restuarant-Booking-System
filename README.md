# Restuarant-Booking-System
A booking system made with WPF and C#.
The user can make a booking.
Choosing time and date when the user want to book.
If a time and date already exist the user cant book that time and date.

The time and dates saves in a JSON file.
When the program is restarts the last results still remain and also the updates.
If the user clicks show bookings the result from last time will show up.
But if the user dont click show bookings and add a new booking the program will renew the booking and get rid of the old one.
